# 🚗 SAS Project – Exploratory Data Analysis of Cars Dataset

**Author:** Fábio  
**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/Fabio-ux-tech/sas-cars-analysis](https://github.com/Fabio-ux-tech/sas-cars-analysis)

---

## 🎯 Goal
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a polished HTML report using **SAS Studio** and the built-in `SASHELP.CARS` dataset.

---

## 🧩 Project Steps
1. Data import and setup (`sashelp.cars` → working copy)  
2. Data cleaning (duplicates, missing values, outlier flags)  
3. Feature creation (`PriceDiff`, `PowerToWeight`)  
4. Descriptive statistics and segment summaries  
5. Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, box plots)  
6. Correlation and simple regression model  
7. Export of results and automated HTML report  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SAS OnDemand for Academics (SAS Studio)
- PROC SQL, PROC MEANS, PROC FREQ, PROC REG, PROC CORR, PROC SGPLOT, PROC SGPANEL
- ODS HTML for reporting

---

## 📊 Deliverables
- `cars_project.sas` → SAS code file  
- `segment_summary.csv` → Summary by Type and Origin  
- `cars_report.html` → Visual report with insights  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Sports cars and SUVs have the highest average MSRP and horsepower.  
- Compact and Sedans provide better fuel efficiency (MPG).  
- Strong correlation between Horsepower and Price (MSRP).  

---

## 🧠 Learnings
This project taught me how to:
- Work with SAS libraries and data steps  
- Automate reports using ODS  
- Combine EDA and visualization into a structured SAS workflow
